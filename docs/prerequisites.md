1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 10.x
   ```sh
   # To check if node is installed and find its version, run
   node -v
   ```
   > If you face problem updating your node then you might need a Node version manager tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
1. [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) >= 1.5
   ```sh
   # To check if yarn is installed and find its version, run
   yarn -v
   ```
   > We only use Yarn as our official Node package manager, and so we request you to use `Yarn` instead of `npm` and commit `yarn.lock` file.
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

   ```sh
   # check your docker installation
   $ docker --version
   # This should output your docker version
   ```
