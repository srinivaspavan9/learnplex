# Prerequisites

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 12.x
   ```bash
   # To check if node is installed and find its version, run
   node -v
   ```
   > If you face problem updating your node then you might need a Node version manager tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
   
   - If you don't know that how to update our `node` using `nvm`, then just folow [these steps](https://github.com/coderplex/learnplex/tree/docs/pages/node-install.mdx): 

1. [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) >= 1.22.x
   ```bash
   # To check if yarn is installed and find its version, run
   yarn -v
   ```
   > We only use Yarn as our official Node package manager, and so we request you to use `Yarn` instead of `npm` and commit `yarn.lock` file.
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
	> For `Windows` users download and install `Docker` and `Docker ToolBox`.For `Mac` users `Docker` is enough.
	> For `Linux` users follow the installation steps from [Docker installation steps](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04)
   ```bash
   # check your docker installation
   docker --version
   # This should output your docker version
   ```
